- **assignment_1/**: Can be found in the file (`script.R`).
- **raw_data/**: Contains the original dataset (`taxi_zone_lookup.csv`).
- **assignment_2/**: Can be found in the file (`Assignment2.BT466.R`).
- **bivariate_plots.png/**: Includes bivariate graphs from assignment 2
- **univariate_plots.png/**: Includes bivariate graphs from assignment 2
- **assignment3.qmd**: A Quarto document presenting the analysis, findings, and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and its structure.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning steps included renaming columns, handling missing values, and creating new variables.
- Summarized data with descriptive statistics and trends.
- Created visualizations such as histograms, density plots, and scatter plots to explore relationships within the data.

This project demonstrates skills in R programming, data analysis, and visualization using tools like `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. It is version-controlled via GitHub to ensure reproducibility and collaboration.
