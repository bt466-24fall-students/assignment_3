# NYC Taxi Zone Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the NYC Taxi Zone Lookup dataset to explore trends and patterns in taxi zones across New York City. It was completed as a three-part assignment for a data analytics course, emphasizing data cleaning, summarization, and visualization.

## Project Structure
- **raw_data/**: Contains the original dataset (`taxi_zone_lookup.csv`).
- **processed_data/**: Contains the cleaned and processed dataset (`zone_lookup_cleaned.csv`).
- **scripts/**: Includes R scripts used for data cleaning and analysis:
  - `data_download.R`: Downloads and reads the dataset.
  - `data_cleaning.R`: Cleans, transforms, and prepares the dataset for analysis.
- **assignment3.qmd**: A Quarto document presenting the analysis, findings, and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and its structure.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning steps included renaming columns, handling missing values, and creating new variables.
- Summarized data with descriptive statistics and trends.
- Created visualizations such as histograms, density plots, and scatter plots to explore relationships within the data.

This project demonstrates skills in R programming, data analysis, and visualization using tools like `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. It is version-controlled via GitHub to ensure reproducibility and collaboration.
