# Assignment 3

#### Group 6: Erin Hardiman, Griffin Holmes, Joey Lim

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

This project analyzes economic indicators for the state of Iowa. The data set includes columns such as month/year, residential building permits, fuel consumption, average weekly unemployment claims, and profits from resources like corn, hogs, and soybeans. The goal is to enhance our Git and R analytics skills while deriving key insights about Iowaâ€™s economy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods

### Data Set Preparation

1.  Downloaded the data set from the Iowa government data portal.
2.  Cleaned column names and added descriptive units to key columns.
3.  Selected 12 key columns based on relevance.
4.  Created a new column, `Average_Profits`, as the mean of four agricultural profit columns.

### Analysis

-   **Data Exploration**: Used `skimr` for initial exploration and summary statistics (`mean`, `median`, `SD`).
-   **Data Visualization**: Created histograms and scatter plots to identify patterns and trends.
-   **Missing Data**: Checked for missing data and ensured the data set was clean.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Results

### Summary Statistics

-   **Key Observations**:
    -   Corn and Soybean Profits: Large difference between mean and median indicates outliers.
    -   Hog and Cattle Profits: Stable with normal mean and median.
    -   Residential Building Permits: High standard deviation reflects economic recessions.
    -   Diesel Consumption: High volatility due to seasonal driving habits and oil prices.
    -   Iowa Stock Market and Agricultural Futures: High SD shows investor uncertainty.

3.  Scatter plot of Avg Weekly Unemployment Claims vs Residential Building Permits: ![](scripts/unemployment_vs_building.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discussion

### Key Insights

1.  **Agricultural Profit Volatility**: Crops (corn, soybeans) show more volatility than livestock (hogs, cattle).
2.  **Economic Recession Impact**: Residential building permits and unemployment claims are highly sensitive to economic downturns.
3.  **Diesel Consumption**: Seasonal patterns and oil price fluctuations contribute to high variability.

### Next Steps

-   Analyze correlations between agricultural profits and leading economic indicators.
-   Investigate regional differences within Iowa if granular data is available.
-   Predict future trends using machine learning techniques.
